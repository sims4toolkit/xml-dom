# Sims 4 Toolkit - XML DOM (@s4tk/xml-dom)

## Overview

This package contains an XML DOM that is tailored for use with Sims 4 tuning files. This XML DOM is general enough to be reused for non-tuning resources, such as ASMs or XML-represented SimData, but is not general enough for uses outside of The Sims 4 modding.

**PLEASE NOTE**: Proper documentation for this package will be provided when the Sims 4 Toolkit website has been completed. For now, please reference this README's Documentation section, where the TS declaration file stubs are provided.

## Installation

Install the package as a dependency from npm with the following command:

```sh
npm i @s4tk/xml-dom
```
